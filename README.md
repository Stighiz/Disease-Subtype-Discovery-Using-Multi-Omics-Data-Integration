This study addresses the problem of prostate cancer subtype discovery through multi-omics data integration. Three omic layers, respectively mRNA, miRNA, and protein expression, are integrated using Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), matrix averaging and NEighborhood based Multi-Omics clustering (NEMO), to generate a unified representation of the data. Clustering approaches, including Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) and Spectral Clustering are applied to identify potential subtypes, which are then compared with known reference prostate cancer classifications. The aim is to capture complex molecular patterns, enabling refined diagnostics and therapies in precision medicine while overcoming limitations of traditional methods like gene preselection and independent data analysis.
